# Database Implementation for a Car Rental Company

Problem: Smile, a car rental company, wants to develop a relational database to store and organize all of the data of its car rental system: comprehensive information on all aspects of the rental process, from the initial hire agreement to the vehicle return and fault report, as well as information on the companyâ€™s outlets, staff, and clients. The company also wants to equip the database to store additional information that may be relevant to the company, such as payment information following vehicle rental (the amount paid, the date payment was made, the method of transaction used), or the locations at which a vehicle was rented and returned.
